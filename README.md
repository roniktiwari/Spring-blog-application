# Spring-blog-application

1.     This is a spring based application
                    - In this project we are building the rest APIs
                             - REST stands for Representational state transfer
                             - State means Data , Representational means Data fronat ( it can be xml , json , html etc )
                             - tansfer means carring data between client and server
                   
2.    Client will send http request to the server , server will process the request and prepare the respsose accordingly 

3.    How we can say that a particular API is Rest API  ? 
                                  - Client server server should be independent of each other ,  it doesn't matter i what language the backend of the application is developed 
                                  - Stateless   : - No data should be stored on the server during the processing of the request , The state of session should be saved on clients 
                                                    ends 
                                                    
                                  - The client should have the ability to store responses in cache , this greatly improve the performance of the API 
                                  -
